# üéì Placement Prediction Web App

## üìå About the Project

This project aims to help students predict their **placement eligibility** based on their academic performance and skillset. By entering a few key details such as CGPA, project experience, certifications, and soft skills, students can get real-time insights into their chances of being placed.

## üß≠ Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Dataset Collection

I began by finding a well-structured dataset (from Kaggle) containing faetures related to academic performance and skill development that will help in determining if a student will get placed or not.


---

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

* Checked for **null values**, duplicates, and **inconsistencies**
* Cleaned data using `pandas` and `numpy`

---

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Used **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **pandas profiling** to visualize data
* Analyzed feature relationships using:
  * Correlation matrix
* Dropped features that had **low correlation** with the target variable to improve model accuracy

---

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing

* Scaled numerical features
* Encoded categorical variables if present(converting yes/no to 0/1)

---

### Step 5: Model Building

* Split dataset into **training and testing** sets using `train_test_split`
* Since this was a **binary classification** problem, I tested multiple algorithms:

  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Support Vector Machines
  * Decision Tree
  * **Random Forest Classifier** (final choice)
* Evaluated models using:

  * **Accuracy Score**

>  **Final Model Chosen:** Random Forest Classifier
>  **Reason:** Best accuracy and generalization on test data

---

### Step 6: Model Saving

* Saved the trained model using `pickle` for later use in deployment.

```python
import pickle

pickle.dump(rf, open('prediction_model.pkl', 'wb'))
```

---

### Step 7: Deployment

Built the web app using HTML, CSS (frontend) and Flask (backend).
Integrated the trained model to predict placement based on user input.
Deployed the app on Render for public access.
